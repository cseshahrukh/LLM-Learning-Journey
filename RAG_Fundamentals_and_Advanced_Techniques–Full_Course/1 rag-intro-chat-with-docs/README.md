# Environmental Setup

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the environment, ensure you have:
- A working installation of **Python** (preferably the latest version).
- Basic familiarity with virtual environments in Python.

## Steps to Set Up the Environment

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed). You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Create a Virtual Environment** to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv basic-rag
   ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source basic-rag/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   pip install openai
   pip install chromadb
   ```
5. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add the following line to specify your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...........
     ```

## Running the Project
Once the environment is set up, explore the code and run the project with:
```bash
python ./app.py
```
(This assumes you have opened the project in the **RAG Intro** directory.)
